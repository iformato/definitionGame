# definitionGame

Introduction

The definition game is a python program that pulls from a list of words and searches the word's definition. It displays the defintion and the user is prompted to guess the word, given this and the length. The user is allowed to add their own words to the word bank, which will add the word to file1.txt. Should a player find a word to be harmful or offensive, they can choose to place the word into a "badwords" file, which will be read at the beginning of each game to ensure that the word is not received again.

Details

The bot was programmed in python 3.10. It utilizes BeautifulSoup4 as well as requests.
